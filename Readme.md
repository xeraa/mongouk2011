This is a simple test project I used to show some Morphia features at MongoUK2011.

## Requirements
*   JDK7+
*   Maven2+ (tested with Maven2 and Maven3)
*   MongoDB 2.0+

An IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ is highly recommended but not required.


## Getting started
Inside the base folder (where the pom.xml file is located) run the following commands to get started - this assumes that you have MongoDB running on the default port:

    mvn test
